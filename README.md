Here are some possible strategies for implementing the requirements you have listed:

To authenticate users, you could use a secure login system   you could create your own login system using password-based authentication and measures to prevent against common threats like brute-force attacks and password reuse.

To implement different levels of permissions for different types of users, you could use a role-based access control system. This would involve assigning different users to different roles (such as "admin," "staff," and "reader") and defining the specific actions that each role is allowed to perform. For example, you could allow admins to have full access to the system, staff to have import/export access but not delete or overwrite files, and readers to have read-only access.

To ensure that the system is secure, you could use encryption to protect the files stored in the system. This could involve using a secure encryption algorithm such as AES to encrypt the files before they are stored, and then decrypting them when they are accessed.

To make the system available and able to handle requests within 1 second for any file size, you could consider using a distributed system design with multiple servers to handle the load. You could also optimize the system for performance by using caching, load balancing, and other performance-enhancing techniques.

To make the system scalable to millions of users, you could use a distributed system design with multiple servers and use techniques such as horizontal scaling (adding more servers to handle the load) and vertical scaling (increasing the resources of individual servers).

To handle conflicts when two users try to modify the same file in parallel, you could use a version control system or a conflict resolution strategy such as last writer wins or using a merge function to combine the changes made by both users.

To generate detailed logs for every action in the system, you could use a logging library or framework such as Logger or Winston to capture and store log messages from different parts of the system. You could also consider implementing auditing functionality to track specific actions taken by users.

Given that 90% of the users are readers, you may want to optimize the system for read operations by using techniques such as caching or read replicas to improve the performance of read requests. You could also consider implementing a tiered access system where read-only users are directed to a separate set of servers or infrastructure that is optimized for read operations.
